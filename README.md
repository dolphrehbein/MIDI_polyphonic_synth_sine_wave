# MIDI_polyphonic_synth_sine_wave
Turn Arduino Mega into an 8 bit polyphonic synthesizer using a MIDI input circuit and a R2R DAC.
## Arduino spec requirements ##
Arduino Mega - 10 KB Flash - 4KB SRAM
## R2R ladder description ##
On the Arduino Mega wire pins 30-37 to the R2R DAC from the Most Signifigant Bit to the Least Signifigant Bit. Wire ground to the end of the last 2R resistor (LSB) and the output speaker to the front of the first 2R resistor (MSB). You'll also want to make sure to connect your speaker ground to the ground of the arduino. You will want your R value to be small (I used 10 ohms) to not drop all of your signal through the ladder. You won't want to use a value less than 10 ohms as the max pinoutput for arduino is 40 mA. If you have a low voltage rail to rail op amp you can use it as a buffer instead.
A better explanation can be found on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_ladder
## MIDI input description ##
It is possible to wire the data pin directly to your Rxn port on your Arduino, but it is suggested that you use an optocoupler as described on the MIDI.org website https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/midi-din-electrical-specification
